# Introduction

This is a continuation of a [previous post](introeda). In that article, I gathered data about deaths from pneumonia and influenza in the United States for the years between 2009 and 2019. More information about where I found the data and what I did to prepare it for analysis can be found there. 

In this article, I will be sharing some of the results of my exploration and some potential interpretations.

# Visualizations

First, I want to explore the trends of pneumonia and influenza across the decade. Are there any patterns that we can initially see?
