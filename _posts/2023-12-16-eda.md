# Introduction

This is a continuation of a previous post from December 5. In that article, I gathered data about deaths from pneumonia and influenza in the United States for the years between 2009 and 2019. More information about where I found the data and what I did to prepare it for analysis can be found there. 

In this article, I will be sharing some of the results of my exploration and some potential interpretations.

# Visualizations

First, I want to explore the trends of pneumonia and influenza across the decade. Are there any patterns that we can initially see?

For the flu, we can see that over the course of the decade, the number of deaths increase. This presents a worrying statistic, and further data from earlier and later years would probably help to clarify this pattern. This could represent a cycle accross decades, or it could represent a worrying trend toward more fatal cases of the flu. There is one significant dip during 2016, and that could also be another question of interest. It seems with the current data that more effort should be put into preventing the spread of the flu for future years.

Pneumonia seems to be much more stable in terms of trends. There is a slight decrease year by year of the number of deaths by pneumonia, which is good, but compared to the sheer number of people who die from pneumonia it is a very small decrease.

This also raises the question of how these fatal diseases compare across US Regions. There are 10 regions:

1 - Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont \
2 - New York, New Jersey \
3 - Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia \
4 - Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee \
5 - Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin \
6 - Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas \ 
7 - Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska \
8 - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming \
9 - Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada \
10 - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington \

It is much more noticeable here that 2016 was much less deadly in terms of deaths from influenza. For some of the regions, there is much less dramatic change across the years, but for regions 4,5,6, and 9, 2018 was by far the worst year for the flu.

Similarly to the global data, pneumonia seems much more stable, and much more deadly. Many more people die from pneumonia in each region than from the flu, and there is a slight downward trend in the number of deaths from this disease.

It seems that across the decade, the flu has gotten more dangerous and pneumonia has gotten slightly less dangerous. Pneumonia is still much more deadly and worth more effort in trying to prevent. How do these diseases trend across seasons? Are there times during the year that are more dangerous?

It is clear that December through February represent the deadliest time for influenza and pneumonia. This compares well with the idea that diseases are more common in the winter, since more people getting sick can lead to more people getting fatally sick.

Is death more common in the winter just because of disease? Taking Utah for example, we can see that much of the change does seem to be due to disease.

![Utah Scatterplot]({{ lotuseat3r.github.io }}/assets/images/scatterplot_utah_deaths.png)

The graph for Utah shows that it follows the same general trends, and since we are working on a relative scale, that relatively more people die from influenza and pneumonia in the winter than in the summer months. 

# Summary

Across all of the data, it seems that the flu is getting more dangerous and that pneumonia is maintaining a very similar deadliness across the years. We can also see that death due to flu or pneumonia peaks in January and is much lower through the rest of the year. Further data would be needed to see if the worrying trend of more deadly flu outbreaks will continue. 

Through even a simple data analysis like this, we can learn about infectious diseases and their potential impact on future years. We can then create preventative plans to help prevent negative trends from continuing and encourage positive trends to grow.
